# Student-Performance-Analyser
Student Performance Analyzer is an application that aims in improving the performance of the student by taking into account the various factors that can possibly affect their performance. 

Studentsâ€™ performance cannot be judged only by what they score, there are various reasons why a student cannot perform well. 

Let us take a scenario where a student has the ability to score well but due to family situations like parents separated or he/she is coming from a family which has a lot of issues, in such a situation he/she will not be able to concentrate properly and score. 

Another situation is where a student spends time going out partying with his/her friends but at the same time is able to score well in the exams, that is because he/she spends their timr studying and at the same time goes out as well. 

Like this there can be many situations where student can or cannot perform well in the examinations, the reasons are unknown to us as the current system doesn't take into account the various socio-economic factors like alcohol consumption, romantic interest, family status, etc. 

Thereby the SPA (Student Performance Analyser) is used by designing a model which takes into consideration the socio-economic factors as one of the inputs and based on the algorithm used it generates clusters. i.e. grouping the student performance based on the factors which are more efficient and help in the bridging the gap between the students & the teacher
